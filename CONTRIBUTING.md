#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
- Check the Debugging guide for the corresponding project and look for the enhancement that is already available. 
- Check the FAQs on the forum for a list of common questions and problems.
- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. 

### Contribute code
We use git flow in this repo. If you want to contribute through code, please fork an existing branch to work on your feature. If you're working on a current issue, respond to that issue with "I'm working on this". When you are done, submit a pull request to join your contribution to the branch you forked. Before submiting your request, please:
- Implement functional, passing test cases that test your contribution
- Check that all previous test cases and other status checks are passing.

## Pull Requests<a name="requests"></a>
The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain the project’s quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for the project’s maintainers to review contributions

## Style guidelines
### Git commit
- Use present tense ("Add feature", not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to...", not "Moves cursor to...")
- Keep the first line to once sentence.

### Python style guide
Please follow the [PEP8 guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python. In addition, please follow the following conventions:
- Use underscores to separate words in non class names: n_samples rather than nsamples.
- Use relative imports for code. For test cases, use absolute imports.
- Do not use import \*, as it has been discouraged by the [official Python recommendations](https://docs.python.org/3.1/howto/doanddont.html#at-module-level).

### Documentation
- Use pdoc3
